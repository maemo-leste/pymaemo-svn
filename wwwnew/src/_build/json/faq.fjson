It offers strong support for integration with other languages and tools, comes with extensive standard libraries, and can be learned in a few days.</blockquote>\n<p><strong>What is PyMaemo?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nIt is the Python package ported to run in Maemo based devices.</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Does PyMaemo come installed by default?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nNo, but there are some requirements and we expect to fulfill all of them in a near future.</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why to use two diferent .install files?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nDue to a limitation in Application Manager, only one repository can be handled by a .install file. PyMaemo depends on two repositories, to avoid duplication of packages. One repository contains base packages and another contains PyMaemo itself. This behaviour will change in a next release of Application Manager.</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why I get &#8220;missing dependencies&#8221; message when I try to install PyMaemo?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nBecause you have to use both .install files (read previous question) as described at installation page.</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why do some modules (e.g.: curses) are missing?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nIn order to keep the platform small and supportable, PyMaemo only comes with the most commonly used packages.</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why do I get the error &lt;put some error message here&gt;?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nFirst make sure that you are running python2.5 explicitly, as python inside scratchbox defaults to scratchbox&#8217; python (2.3)</blockquote>\n</div>\n", "display_toc": false, "title": "FAQ", "sourcename": "faq.txt", "current_page_name": "faq", "next": {"link": "../installation/", "title": "Installation"}, "rellinks": [["installation", "Installation", "N", "next"], ["getinvolved", "Get Involved", "P", "previous"]], "meta": {}, "parents": [], "toc": "<ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"\">FAQ</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "prev": {"link": "../getinvolved/", "title": "Get Involved"}, "metatags": ""}
