Using and Contributing
----------------------

This repository uses python (v2.3 provided by rootstrap image) to generate the
entire source tree. To have a smaller repository, this version is based on patches.
All modules that have source code in tar.gz format are downloaded from their
websites. Then the patches are downloaded from pymaemo repository to be applied.
Modules like python-hildon, that does not have external source code will be kept
completly in pymaemo repository.

-Downloading
To download the newest version of pymaemo, just run 'python ./create_tree.py'.
It will get all source code needed, apply the patches and build deb packages.

-Contributing
Pymaemo source tree uses 'quilt' to keep patches. It is a great tool, that provides
great control over modifications in source code and generates patch files, to be
uploaded on pymaemo svn repository.
First of all you need to export the QUILT_PATCHES variable. This can be done
copying .quiltrc file to your home or running export QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches.
Before starting modifications, you must run quilt add <filename>, where filename
is the file that will be modified. Then run quilt new <patch_filename> to create
a new patch file named <patch_filename>. Now you can edit files. After this, run
quilt refresh, to flush all information inside patch file. To commit this new patch,
enter debian/patches directory and run svn commit -m "Message describing what you
did". To have more information on quilt and svn tools, take a look on their webpages
or manpages.
