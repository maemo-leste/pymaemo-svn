/*
GPS BT management API. The API is used by those applications that
wish to use services provided by gps daemon i.e., they wish to receive
GPS data from the daemon. See README file for more details.

/* Internal context information */

  gpsmgr_t mgr;
  char **rfcomms; /* what devices where found (null terminated array),

/* Start function finds out the available GPS BT devices and starts
 * the gpsd if it is not running. If no GPS BT devices are found, then
 * an error is returned.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *    bda 
 *       BT address of the GPS device, normally this is left
 *       to null but if this API cannot find a suitable GPS
 *       BT device, the application can ask the BT device
 *       from the user and supply the address here.
 *
 *    debug_level
 *       debug level (set to 0 to use the default)
 *
 *    gpsd_debug_level
 *       gpsd debug level (set to 0 to use the default)
 *
 *    port
 *       gpsd port (set to 0 to use the default (2947))
 *
 *    error_buf
 *       user supplied error buffer (optional), if there is an error
 *       the API puts error message to this buffer
 *
 *    error_buf_max_len
 *       max length of the error buffer, set to 0 if error
 *       message is not needed in caller program
 *
 *    timeout_ms
 *       timeout (in ms) when waiting dbus replies, set to 0 to use
 *       the library default (5 seconds), if set to <0 then use
 *       the dbus default (whatever that is).
 *
 *    ctx
 *       caller must allocate and clear this struct before call
 *
 * Returns:
 *    <0 : error, check errno for more details
 *     0 : ok
 *
 * Example:
 *    The default call would be
 *         gpsbt_start(NULL, 0, 0, 0, &ctx);
 *
 * If the GPSD_PROG environment variable is defined, then it is used
 * when starting the program, otherwise "gpsd" will be used as a program
 * name. This way you can override the program name and/or path if necessary.
 *
 * If the GPSD_CTRL_SOCK environment variable is defined, then it is used
 * as a location to gpsd control socket, otherwise the default control socket
 * is /tmp/.gpsd_ctrl_sock
