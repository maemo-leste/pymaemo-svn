Description: Python Imaging Library
 The Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds an image object to your Python
 interpreter. You can load images from a variety of file formats, and
 apply a rich set of image operations to them.
 .
 Image Objects:
  o Bilevel, greyscale, palette, true colour (RGB), true colour with
    transparency (RGBA).
  o colour separation (CMYK).
  o Copy, cut, paste operations.
  o Flip, transpose, resize, rotate, and arbitrary affine transforms.
  o Transparency operations.
  o Channel and point operations.
  o Colour transforms, including matrix operations.
  o Image enhancement, including convolution filters.
 .
 File Formats:
  o Full (Open/Load/Save): BMP, EPS (with ghostscript), GIF, IM, JPEG,
    MSP, PDF, PNG, PPM, TIFF, XBM.
  o Read only (Open/Load): ARG, CUR, DCX, FLI, FPX, GBR, GD, ICO, IMT, IPTC,
    MCIDAS, MPEG, PhotoCD, PCX, PIXAR, PSD, TGA, SGI, SUN, TGA, WMF, XPM.
  o Save only: PDF, EPS (without ghostscript).

Description: Examples for the Python Imaging Library
 The Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds an image object to your
 Python interpreter. You can load image objects from a variety of file
 formats, and apply a rich set of image operations to them.
 .
 This package contains PIL API documentation and some example scripts.
 You may also want to look at the python-imaging-doc-html or
 python-imaging-doc-pdf packages for the PIL handbook documentation.
