Description: pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries
 lxml is a new Python binding for libxml2 and libxslt, completely
 independent from these existing Python bindings. Its aim:
 .
   * Pythonic API.
   * Documented.
   * Use Python unicode strings in API.
   * Safe (no segfaults).
   * No manual memory management!
 .
 lxml aims to provide a Pythonic API by following as much as possible
 the ElementTree API, trying to avoid having to invent too many new APIs,
 or you having to learn new things -- XML is complicated enough.
