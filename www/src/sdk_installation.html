<h2>SDK Installation (scratchbox)</h2>


<p>
  The first thing is to add the maemo <em>extras</em> repository (where Python is located) to your
  list of package sources. To do that you'll have to edit the file <var>/etc/apt/sources.list</var>,
  which should look like this:
</p>
<pre>
deb http://repository.maemo.org/ bora free non-free
deb-src http://repository.maemo.org/ bora free
deb file:/home/[username]/maemo-sdk-nokia-binaries_3.1 bora explicit</pre>
<p>Add the following line to it:</p>
<pre>deb http://repository.maemo.org/extras bora free non-free</pre>

<p>Now resynchronize your package index files with the following command:</p>
<pre>[sbox-SDK_X86: ~] > apt-get update</pre>

<p>
  After that you are ready to install <var>python2.5</var> plus bindings. All Python 2.5 for Maemo
  packages are named <var>python2.5-*</var>, so you can install all at once with <var>apt-get</var>
  if you want to doing the following:
</p>
<pre>[sbox-SDK_X86: ~] > apt-get install python2.5*</pre>

<p>To see all python-related packages issue this command</p>
<pre>[sbox-SDK_X86: ~] > apt-get cache search python*</pre>

<p>
   Note that you'll see also scratchbox's own python (version 2.3) which you must not use for
   your maemo development.
